import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const userSlice = createSlice({
  name: "user",
  initialState: null,
  reducers: {
    addUser: (state, action) => {
      return action.payload;
    },
    removeUser: (state, action) => {
      return null;
    },
  },
});

export const { addUser, removeUser } = userSlice.actions;

export default userSlice.reducer;  const handleLogin = async () => {
    try {
      const res = await axios.post(
        BASE_URL + "/login",
        {
          emailId,
          password,
        },
        { withCredentials: true }
      );
      dispatch(addUser(res.data));
      return navigate("/");
    } catch (err) {
      setError(err?.response?.data || "Something went wrong");
    }
  }; suppose i open my project in two tabs in one tab i add user named nitish ,it will update userslice to nitish and in second tab i add user named salony,so it will update userslice to salony then why it is still working for nitish and userslice is updated for salony


ChatGPT said:
Redux state is maintained per tab/session, meaning each browser tab runs its own separate Redux store in memory.

Here's what happens in your case:

First Tab: You log in as Nitish, and userSlice updates to store Nitish in that tab's Redux state.
Second Tab: You log in as Salony, and userSlice updates to store Salony in the second tabâ€™s Redux state.
Since each tab maintains its own Redux store, the first tab is unaffected by the update in the second tab. It still has Nitish because it doesnâ€™t know about the update in the other tab.

How to Sync Across Tabs?
If you want the user state to be consistent across all tabs, you need to use localStorage, sessionStorage, or a global state management solution like Context API with persistent storage.

Solution 1: Use localStorage
Modify your slice to store and retrieve user data from localStorage:

javascript
Copy
Edit
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const initialState = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user")) || null;

const userSlice = createSlice({
  name: "user",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    addUser: (state, action) => {
      localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(action.payload));
      return action.payload;
    },
    removeUser: () => {
      localStorage.removeItem("user");
      return null;
    },
  },
});

export const { addUser, removeUser } = userSlice.actions;
export default userSlice.reducer;
This way, when you log in, the user data is saved in localStorage and persists across tabs.

Solution 2: Use window.addEventListener("storage")
To ensure that all tabs sync when the user changes, you can listen for changes in localStorage like this:

javascript
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  const handleStorageChange = () => {
    const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user"));
    if (user) {
      dispatch(addUser(user));
    } else {
      dispatch(removeUser());
    }
  };

  window.addEventListener("storage", handleStorageChange);
  return () => window.removeEventListener("storage", handleStorageChange);
}, []);
This ensures that if one tab updates the user, all other tabs update as well when the localStorage changes.
